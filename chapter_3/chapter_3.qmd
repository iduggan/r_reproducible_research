# Chapter 3: Seeking Help

### Help functions in R
  * ?function_name OR help(function_name)
  
### Getting help with packages:
  * "vignettes": usually most packages offer tutorials and extended examples with this function
  * try using "vignette(package="package-name")
  * if a function has no vignettes, try help(package-name)

### "Fuzzy" search on function names: 
  *if you're not exactly sure of the name "??function_name"

### Ask for help on : https://stackoverflow.com/
